Algorithm Description:

The vehicle routing problem is solved using the OR-Tools library by Google. The algorithm considers both distance and capacity constraints.

Distance Constraint:
The algorithm uses a time_callback function to calculate the time required based on the indices and the inverse of speed (labeled as speed in the code). Since the OR-Tools library only accepts integer values, the speed inverse values are normalized. The time_callback method returns distance * speed, where speed is actually the speed inverse.

Capacity Constraint:
A standard template is implemented to handle the capacity constraint. It uses a demand array for the nodes and a capacity array for the vehicles.

Implementation:

The algorithm provides an optimal solution that satisfies both the distance and capacity constraints. The solution is then outputted to the routing.txt file.
